# Dataset Generator

Web scraping and automatic dataset generation tool for question-answer datasets with advanced export capabilities and LLM integration.

## 🎯 Objective

Create quality datasets for training AI models by automatically scraping reliable sources and generating contextualized question-answer pairs. Export datasets to multiple formats including Langfuse for training data management.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Launch
make start
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project is designed with a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct components:

- **Scraper**: Retrieval of web content from specified URLs
- **LLM Client**: Interaction with language models to generate question-answer pairs
- **Data Manager**: Data management and dataset storage with multiple export formats
- **Pipeline**: Orchestration of the complete dataset generation process
- **Export Module**: Advanced dataset export to various platforms (Langfuse, JSON, CSV, etc.)

## ✨ Key Features

- **Multi-source Scraping**: Support for various web sources and content types
- **AI-Powered QA Generation**: Leverage state-of-the-art LLMs for intelligent question-answer pair creation
- **Langfuse Integration**: Direct export to Langfuse for dataset management and training workflows
- **Multiple Export Formats**: JSON, CSV, JSONL, and platform-specific formats
- **Quality Control**: Automated validation and filtering of generated content
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of large-scale data generation
- **API Interface**: RESTful API for programmatic access and integration
